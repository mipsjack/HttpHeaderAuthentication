# HttpHeaderAuthentication

A Spring Security based project to authenticate users based on HTTP-header attributes.
Only use the source if you know what you are doing. A common header attribute for authentication and authorization may be unsafe because it can be easily modified. 
A more sophisticated approach is using BasicAuthentication, as provided by SpringSecurity, when authenticating users via headers.
