# HttpHeaderAuthentication

A Spring Security based project to authenticate users based on HTTP-header attributes.
Only use the source if you know what you are doing. A common Header attribute for authentication and authorization may be unsafe because it can be easily modified. 
A more sophisticated way is using BasicAuthentication, as provided by SpringSecurity, when authenticating users.
Most of the code was taken from [Link to youtube video form user  Geoff Bourne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UWxuF4S-I4).
